[NOTE]
====
.Encoding
While the mnemonic of this instruction is consistent with that of the other RISC-V floating-point
convert instructions, a new encoding is
used in bits 24:20 to indicate that the source is BF16.

Description:: 
Converts a BF16 value to an FP32 value. The conversion is exact.

This new floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instruction is defined analogously to the
pre-existing floating-point-to-floating-point conversion instructions.

The BF16 encoded value is shifted to the left by 16 places and the least significant 16 bits are
written with 0s. The result is NaN-boxed by writing the most significant `FLEN`-32 bits with 1s.
